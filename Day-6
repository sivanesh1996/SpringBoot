TO VIEW THE RESULT IN ANOTHER HTML:

To play with data:
->use Model class in spring framework
  *use in parameter of controller
->in this program, we are binding result variable with even or not even based on condition

THYMELEAF:
Server side template engine
*To make the page behave dynamically
for this inside html tag

<html xmlns:th="http://www.thymeleaf.org">
here th->thyme leaf name space
to get predefined syntax: 
th:text="${result}"

result ->String attributeName
even/not even ->Object attribute value
we are binding object with value even/not even

span is an inline html element

If we make html changes in html page,we need to restart server is not necessary by:
application.properties: It is the complete configuration file for spring project
here,
spring.thymeleaf.cache=false;

its by default true, it means if we make changes in html,it 
will keep in cache.If we make it false means it gives upto date data.
So,from now if we make any changes in html page, we dont need
to restart the server but in controller if we make changes we need to restart the server

To Install Thyeme leaf plugin:
help->eclipse market place->thyme leaf search


INPUT THROUGH FORM ELEMENT --> CALL AN CONTROLLER --> FINDS EVE/NOT EVEN AND THROUGH MODEL ATTRIBUTE SEND RESULT TO ANOTHER PAGE
