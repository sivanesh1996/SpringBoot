Web Application Architecture:

Normally 2 types applications:
1.stand alone application

Ex:MS Word

2.Web Application:

google,gmail
applcation on server
through uniform resource locaton we use the application

main component:web server

3 tier client server architecture:

web browser-->client

web browser(google.com)-->web server -->data base remote-->google app output(response)

Layer 1:
client
Layer 2:
web server
Layer 3:
DB

DB as server link to webserver has default directory.
web server has server side scripting langiage (spring)
java means server tom cat

Model -> pojo class having getter and setter
View -> template engine connects to controller not model directly


req -->web server --> server side scripting -->DB ==> NO SECURITY

web server --> controller -->model -->Db -->through view -->browser display

This is standard pattern
