In spring boot, difference[functionalities,where to use] between repository and services

Object Relational mapping [Persistance] [hibernate] through our repository in project contacts Model and make the methods available for the repository

Object Relational mapping functions  [Persistance]

Repository -> data access layer
- directly contacts db and manipulate data

In last project , we have auto-wired repository in Controller, but using repository directly in controller is not recommended
Rather than calling repository diretly from controller , its recommended to call services and from services data has to be accessed 

Service is like a business[logic] layer [write required code] that links repository  . Service first links with controller.

Service -> links business layer and repository [data access layer]

So as per rules,remove the reposiory autowired in Controller. Then create a folder names service inside java/api folder . Create a class EmployeeService.java and give @Service above class name

Requirement: findbyid

Autowire repository in service class and write a function name getEmployeeById with return type Optional<Employee> with parameter int empid and return findbyid from repository

In controller, autowire the service class and in the method return employeeService.getEmployeeById(id)

Run the program and output through postman

This is Enterprise application pattern ie.writing code layer by layer so that security,concept ensure

RECAP: MOdel, Map repo to Model for default db functions,autowire the repository in a service and call the required methods through controller

Now, it seems like we are replicating the method in controller to service but its not like that

Requirement:
If we call employee id, it takes his experiece from db and calculate basic pay,total salary 
-Multiply based on experiece with basic salary
