How to correctly http methods:

GET method is used to locate a particular resource in server.
To get the home page,login page like that

POST method is used to send the data to server.
Like submitting form.

If we send sensitive information from form like password 
through GET method, in url the password will be explicitly 
visible.So for this we should go for POST method


IN html form action if we use POST method we should be use PostMapping annotation in
controller


HTML page call and use it 
In Browser we type url and get html page.Use GetMapping.
--> GetMapping, if used get method in html, in controller we should use GetMapping

We cannot call post method directly from url

Through form, we send data to server-->use post method (standard)
Here use post method in html,so we should use PostMapping in controller.

Form process controller -->PostMapping
