To view postgres database rows in webpage by spring boot web app:

In last session, we display postgres database table in console by toString()
THis displays all rows in toString()
To display certain rows:
By using employee object,display required field by getter method.
For this we need List

---------------

Now we move from console application to web Application

we need 2 dependencies spring web and thymeleaf
Instead of creating new appication, we can add dependencies in pom.xml

https://start.spring.io/

->maven project,fill other details as per our project
add dependencies , spring web,thyme leaf
Then click Explore

In pom.xml, copy the 2 dependencies
and paste it in vs codes pom.xml

Now libraries will be auto-downloaded

Now project is ready as webapp

Now in console application, remove implements commandlinerunner and 
autowired and the overrided method.this means our project is a web application.
We are not going to give input through form.

Now in src/main create a MainController class and use @Controller

Autowired the repository in this class

use getmapping and a method which returns a html page
create list,use findAll,Model object and method addAttribute

Now we sent table data as object through addAttribute

In resources/template , create html file

There will be n number of rows, so we use th:each in table row thymeleaf template syntax.this will iterate and run.In table data use th:text
