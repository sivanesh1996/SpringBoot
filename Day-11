Genrate java entity class automatically to connect with postgres:

To connect java and postgres, we should download JDBC driver
https://jdbc.postgresql.org/download/

Then,download Eclipse IDE for Enterprise Java Developers:
eclipse.org -->download package--> Eclipse IDE for Enterprise Java Developers

https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/

Open 
Eclipse IDE for Enterprise Java Developers ->file -> new JPA project or others ->Jpa

project name:JPADemo;run time:java 11[in my system:jre] -> next ->next ->platform: generic ; JpaImplementation ->download library [to auto generate model class] ->select latest eclipse edition

IAm unable to download library .So i use manage library->new->name:eclipselink->add exeternal jars option and input the jar file [javax.persistence.Convert] from below link
http://www.java2s.com/Code/Jar/j/Downloadjavaxpersistence210rc1jar.htm

Connection:postgres
name:postgres
next
add the postgres downloaded driver
In new driver definition dialogue box,select the current driver JAR in NAme/Type-> then in JAR,remove previous jar and all the the downloaded driver and press ok

database:postgres [DB name]
url:in end /dataBaseName
username:
password:

Test connection->success

Open perspective

in src, right click new->package
name:com.example.model
Right click the package,new ->JPA entities from tables
THis means for set of tables in database ,java entity class automatically created

Schema: public
select the required table->next->If there is more than 1 table, we have to give one to one OR one to many ,if 1 table,its not needed->next->
KEy generator:Identity [ for primary key, manual entry] 
select Always generate optional JPA anotations and DDL parameters->next->it shows class name and click finish

NOw in Employee.java , annotations we give in last session was automatically created


Basically in projects, design DB with schema,tables then DB link to eclipse project and create model classes and copy in spring boot web app and then create repository ,controller
